                "Skidd McMarx" is a play on the expression "skid marks". 
                His name is inconsistently spelled by the subtitles and 
                credits of both the original Ratchet & Clank and Up Your Arsenal, 
                with the former referring to him as "Skid McMarx" and the latter 
                as "Skidd McMarxx." In the 2016 re-imagining, 
                his name was consistently spelled "Skidd McMarx".
